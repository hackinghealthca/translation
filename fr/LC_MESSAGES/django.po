"Hacking Health is an experiment in collaboration. Our hypothesis is that the "

"innovative approaches to some (not all) of healthcare&rsquo;s most "
"entrenched problems. By rapidly building and testing prototypes, we can "
"identify the fraction of ideas that have the potential to scale and at the "

"We utilize a &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; inspired approach that combines front-line "

"concepts that can be rapidly prototyped and refined. While the term “hacker” "

"low-cost prototypes."

"Though, &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; has its origins in software development, this "
"approach is now being applied to tackle a range of social issues from "

"A hackathon is a simple event with a beginning, a middle, and an end. In the "

msgstr ""

#: templates/about/hackathon.html:10
msgid ""
"This isn&rsquo;t the best way to solve every problem. But it&rsquo;s a great "
